# Introduction
This project report presents an analysis of the NYC Bike Share system using Tableau visualization.The NYC Bike Share system provides an alternative mode of transportation, allowing users to rentbicycles for short trips within the city. This report aims to provide a comprehensive overview ofthe system's current status, usage patterns, benefits, challenges, and propose recommendations forimprovement. The analysis is based on data collected from the NYC Department of Transportationand other relevant sources, visualized using Tableau software. The NYC bike share system, knownas GoRider, has revolutionized urban transportation by offering a convenient and sustainable modeof travel. As cities strive to address traffic congestion, reduce pollution, and promote activelifestyles, bike sharing programs have gained significant popularity worldwide. This analysisfocuses on providing a comprehensive understanding of the NYC bike share system, examiningvarious aspects such as demand patterns, user demographics, station dynamics, systemperformance, and its economic impact. The NYC bike share system has become an integral partof the city's transportation infrastructure, catering to the diverse needs of residents, commuters,and tourists alike. 

# Scope
Through the visualizations created using Tableau, the project seeks to achieve several objectives. Firstly, it aims to understand the usage patterns of the bike share system, including peak hours, popular stations, and trip durations. This information can provide valuable insights into user preferences, transportation needs, and areas of high demand.

Secondly, the project aims to identify and highlight the benefits offered by the bike share system. This includes its contribution to sustainability by reducing carbon emissions and traffic congestion, promoting health and fitness through active transportation, and enhancing last-mile connectivity by bridging gaps between public transit stations and final destinations. 

Furthermore, the project intends to address the challenges and limitations faced by the system. This includes analyzing station imbalances, where some stations experience high demand while others remain underutilized, as well as safety concerns associated with cycling in a densely populated city like NYC.

Lastly, the project proposes a new hint to transportation by advocating for the expansion of electric bike share within the existing system. By leveraging Tableau's visualizations, it aims to present the advantages of electric bikes, such as increased accessibility, reduced effort for longer commutes, improved efficiency in balancing bike availability across stations, and enhanced safety features.

Overall, the purpose of this project is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the NYC Bike Share system using Tableau visualization, with the ultimate goal of informing stakeholders and decision- makers about the system's strengths, weaknesses, and potential improvements for a more efficient and sustainable transportation solution in New York City.
